      <h1 class="heading">Hi! I'm LittleKitacho</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I like making things using code, but you could probably tell that.
        Recently, I've really been into web development. My old website shows
        the improvement in my skills from a few years ago, from frameworks
        to a completely custom theme that I hope you enjoy!<br>

          <p class="paragraph">
            ModKit is a Discord Bot that is just the right balance between bloat
            and features, supplementing Discord's own features but not
            reinventing the wheel. It's an idea that I've had for as long as I
            can remenber, and has been a dream of mine for longer. I hope that
            you will check it out and use it for moderating your server!<br>

          <p class="paragraph">
            Sokobot was a Discord Bot created by Polymars, but was shut down
            recently due to the changes to Discord not allowing bots to not use
            slash commands and a general lack of updates. Sokobot Dos is a
            recreation of Sokobot in TypeScript, using slash commands and all
            that jazz. To be updated soonâ„¢

            You see the name, you can guess what this is.<br>
            A collection of random internet card games that I put together for
            fun. Features may be lacking, but they're all single page (ha) games
            that people can run in their browser. Blackjack, one of the only games
            on there at the moment but I'm hoping to change that, was made in a
            weekend for no particular reason, and improved upon until I gave up!<br>
            Currently working on getting some other card games in there, one of
            which I came up with myself (I am that kind of nerd).<br>
            Check it out if you would! It would mean a lot.
